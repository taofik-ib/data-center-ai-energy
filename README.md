# Data-Center Energy Use in the AI Era

This project provides a simple, transparent model of global **data-center electricity consumption** and **CO₂ emissions**, with a focus on how rapidly growing **AI workloads** influence total energy demand. The goal is not to produce a precise forecast, but to create a **clear visual narrative** suitable for presentations, academic work, and exploratory analysis.
